SpaceX Dragon Rockets Repository

The process of creating this project:

1. Identify key entities (Rocket, Mission), define their responsibilities and relationships.
2. Create interfaces (e.g., repositories, services), structure the project into layers
3. For each functionality, write a unit test first
4. Write just enough code to make the test pass
5. Add new features by repeating the cycle: test → implementation → refactoring

I used GitHub Copilot to complete the code and
create tests to make sure the code behaves as expected.
